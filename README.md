Business Sales Performance Analysis
This repository contains a Business Intelligence (BI) project that transforms raw sales data into actionable insights. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the analysis identifies top revenue-generating products and evaluates the effectiveness of store-level marketing strategies.

📊 Business Insights Uncovered
Revenue Drivers: Engineered a Revenue metric to rank products by financial impact rather than just unit count.

Placement Strategy: Analyzed how Product Position (Aisle vs. Front of Store) influences customer purchasing behavior.

Marketing Lift: Evaluated the performance of Promotions to see which campaigns successfully increased sales volume.

Inventory Value: Aggregated total price data by Material to understand the value distribution of the current stock.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Data Handling: Loaded and parsed semicolon-delimited CSV data using Pandas.

Aggregation: Utilized groupby and transform to perform complex multi-level calculations (e.g., Material-based price sums).

Visualization: Developed custom plots including:

Bar Charts for categorical performance comparison.

Pie Charts for share-of-sales distribution.

Histograms for revenue frequency analysis.

Line Plots for material value trends.
